# Share Experiences (MERN Stack Build)

## Front End
Front End is made with React. Running on port 3000.

## Back End
Back End is made with NodeJS, Express and MongoDB. Running on port 5000.

## How to run it on your local machine
- Open two terminals in the cloned directory.
- In the first one, run the following commands: (may ask for system password)
```sh
$ cd server
$ npm install
$ sudo service mongod start
$ npm start
```
- In the next one, run the following commands:
```sh
$ cd client
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
- CAUTION: Start the back-end before starting the front end. Or, obviously, no API request will be able to proceed..
